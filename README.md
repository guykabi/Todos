The 'Todos' provides a fast and accessible platform for managing a daily, weekly and monthly tasks.  
    Each task has it's own time frame which it must be complete.
Categorizes by level of importance and color to distinguish between. 
Each task of course can be edit in any field, change time frame to finish it in and delete it!  

All tasks are shown on a graphical time-line (from nearest to the farthest by date).
Each completed task is getting tracked and represented on a separate graph.
The graph shows all the completed tasks according to the time that it took to complete it relative to other tasks based on importance level!

Task which hasn't been completed in the time frame set to it,  is removed to uncompleted tasks section,
there the user can see all the uncompleted tasks, it origin time to complete and to restore it if will decide to. 
Every uncompleted task has one chance only to be restored! 

The project was developed with React + Node.js + MongoDB. 
State managment was done with React Context API + React Query in order to demonstare a self sustaining app,  which minimizes calls to the server and keeping it's data fresh as possible!
